### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Export static files (if needed)
npm run export
```

## üìö Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Connect Wallet**
   - Click "Connect Wallet" and select your preferred wallet
   - Ensure you're on a supported network (recommend starting with Sepolia testnet)

2. **Get Test Tokens** (Sepolia only)
   - Use the faucet to get test ETH: [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
   - Deploy Test USDT via the deployment wizard for testing

3. **Deploy RWA Factory**
   - Navigate to the "Deploy" tab
   - Choose deployment fee (recommended: 0.001 ETH for testing)
   - Deploy the factory contract

4. **Create RWA Token**
   - Configure token parameters (name, symbol, asset details)
   - Review configuration
   - Deploy through the factory

5. **Manage Contracts**
   - View deployed contracts in the "Contracts" tab
   - Filter by category or verification status
   - Click contract addresses to view on block explorer

### Testing on Sepolia

1. Get Sepolia ETH from faucets
2. Deploy factory with minimal fees
3. Create test RWA tokens for different asset categories
4. Test all functionality before mainnet deployment

## üîß Configuration

### Custom RPC Endpoints

Update `src/config/web3.ts` to use your own RPC endpoints:

```typescript
export const CHAIN_CONFIG = {
  sepolia: {
    rpcUrl: 'https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY',
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Adding New Networks

Use the custom network form in the UI or modify the configuration:

```typescript
const customChain = createCustomChain(
  1337, // Chain ID
  'Local Network',
  'http://localhost:8545'
)
```

## üß™ Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Linting

```bash
# Check code style
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Contract Compilation

The app includes placeholder bytecodes for contracts. For production deployment:

1. Compile Solidity contracts using Hardhat or Foundry
2. Update bytecodes in `src/lib/contract-deployment.ts`
3. Deploy factory contracts to desired networks

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## üîí Security

### Smart Contract Security
- Contracts include standard security patterns (reentrancy protection, ownership controls)
- Pause functionality for emergency situations
- Verification system for asset legitimacy

### Frontend Security
- CSP headers configured in Netlify
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Client-side validation and sanitization

### Recommendations
- Always test on testnets first
- Use hardware wallets for production deployments
- Regular security audits for smart contracts
- Keep dependencies updated
